Ropyxa Recourses (RR)
=======

A mod that adds a wide selection of base materials you've probably seen in other mods â€” but here, everything is brought together in one cohesive system.

Inspired by *Emendatus Enigmatica* (version 1.16.5). In later versions, the developers dropped the unified resource system, so I decided to fully recreate and port it to **NeoForge**.


## ðŸ“¦ What's in the mod?

- Metal ingots, alloys, and crystals  
- Associated items: rods, nuggets, plates, blocks, and more  
- Ores for every non-alloy resource type â€” available in stone, netherrack, end stone, and deepslate variants  


## ðŸ’§ What about fluids?

**No fluids included.**  
Due to the complexity of the new fluid API (seriously, it's 10x harder), I chose not to port them.
